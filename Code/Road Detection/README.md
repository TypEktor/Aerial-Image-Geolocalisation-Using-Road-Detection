# Road Detection
Deep neural networks can be considered a reliable approach in order to deal with semantic
image segmentation problems. As already cited, the first task of this work is
to effectively extract roads from high-resolutional aerial images. This subsection focuses
on describing all the implemented deep neural networks used for achieving the
aforementioned task.
Specifically, three models have been used:
- Original U-Net
- Residual U-Net
- Multi-Residual U-Net
