# Object Detection


Besides roads, buildings can also be considered an effective way to georeference an
aerial image, taken from a UAV, with a referenced map. This work focuses on road
detection; however, roads and buildings may cooperate and produce better results. The
YOLO family of networks have been proven to be very accurate while dealing with
features in aerial images, and thus, these methods have been chosen for this workâ€™s
system.

## YOLO - You Only Look Once
You Only Look Once (YOLO) created by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross
Girshick, and Ali Farhadi (Redmon et al., 2015) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object
detection system.

The below image is a sample of YOLO system, where the image is divided into an S*S grid
of cells. Then by creating bounding boxes and calculating the confidence the system
predict the objects inside the image
