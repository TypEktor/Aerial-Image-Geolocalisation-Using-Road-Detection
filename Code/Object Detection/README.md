# Object Detection


Besides roads, buildings can also be considered an effective way to georeference an
aerial image, taken from a UAV, with a referenced map. This work focuses on road
detection; however, roads and buildings may cooperate and produce better results. The
YOLO family of networks have been proven to be very accurate while dealing with
features in aerial images, and thus, these methods have been chosen for this workâ€™s
system.
